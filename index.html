    <h1>Walkthrough</h1>
    <p>This came out of a 24-hour work sprint to replicate some sophisticated video VFX in to make it more flexible. <a href="">You can see the original here</a></p>
    <p>There's a lot of pieces that go into an effect like this. What follows is an outline of the animations and VFX concepts, all in pure css :)</p>
    <p>Core principles:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Keep the text legible most of the time</li>
      <li>Don't throw too many glitches in per second. Give it space to breathe</li>
      <li>Whitespace never hurt anyone</li>
      <li>Blurs & glows lend a feeling of realism in dark environments (queue neon)</li>
    </ol>
